    Hi! I am Ujjwal. I am an MS student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Prior to this, I was a BS student at IISc. I'm currently interested in High-Energy Physics, especially Quantum Field Theory,
    String Theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence yess. Aside from that, I also have an interest in particle phenomenology.
